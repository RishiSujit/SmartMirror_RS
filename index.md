My first milestone was completing the setup of my Raspberry Pi. While this seems basic this gives a foundation for one to continue to setup software and hardware making it a crucial first step. I had to connect all the components to my monitor download and update software to an SD card. I ran along to some challenges such as SD card issues and the Raspberry Pi refusing to set up. After fixing aftermentioned issues my Raspberry Pi is functional. This is where I will be doing all the coding for the Smart Mirror, so completing the primary setup was important as now the project can forge ahead and work on software and hardware components.
